"""Assemble LM Studio prompts from the shipped skill files.

Nothing is paraphrased: the model reads the same SKILL.md sections, style
guide, type reference, template and example a hosted agent would load. This
module only decides *which* of those go into the context window, because a
local model's window is small. Two profiles:

* ``full`` — SKILL.md §1, §4–§9, §12, the style guide, the type reference,
  the variant template and the matching example (~25k tokens).
* ``lean`` — drops the style guide and §8, keeping the rules the linters
  enforce (~15k tokens). Chosen automatically under a 48k context.
